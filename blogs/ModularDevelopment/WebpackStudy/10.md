# 构建速度优化

## speed-measure-webpack-plugin 插件打出插件和加载器的构建耗时

本人当前目标优化项目二次耗时如下：

## 优化方向

+ babel-loader耗时过长, 需要优化
+ 代码压缩耗时过长
+ 忽略文件耗时过长
+ 生成.map文件耗时过长
+ 初始化打包时生成缓存文件耗时过长
+ additional chunk assets processing阶段耗时过长(涉及到内存分配问题)
+ 各类loader, plugin版本过低, 不匹配webpack4.x, 导致速度过慢


## 初次优化后的首次打包时间

```

## 优化方法

+ babel-loader 查询范围缩小, 拒绝查询node_modules, 当然, 要除去其中有一个需要打包的文件, 这里采用的include
+ TerserPlugin js代码压缩, 同样 exclude掉 `node_modules`
+ 取消使用IgnorePlugin忽略moment.js, 换为`new MomentLocalesPlugin()`这个插件, 忽略掉除en以外的所有语言环境
+ 取消所有的cache-loader, 换效率更高的 `HardSourceWebpackPlugin`, 让二次打包下降到1min左右
+ devtool使用cheap-source-map
+ thread-loader下的线程池中并行的子线程数增大
+ optimization下加强 `tree-shaking`, 打开生产环境下的 `usedExports`, 用于标记需要摇掉的"树叶"
+ optimization下开启 Scope Hoisting, 也就是在生产环境下打开 `concatenateModules`
+ 升级loader和plugin

## 更进一步的提速

1. 升级到webpack5.x

2. 处理 `MiniCssExtractPlugin.loader` 后不调用style-loader报错的问题, 按理来说使用了`MiniCssExtractPlugin.loader`, 就不再需要style-loader了(使用了link, 也就不需要style标签植入了), 但是这里取消了style-loader会报错。

3. new HardSourceWebpackPlugin.ParallelModulePlugin, 处理这个实验性质的模块导致的中断问题, 多线程环境下增加首次打包时生成缓存文件的速度。

4. splitChunks拆分文件没有遵守minSize这个规则, 可能是其他地方影响了
